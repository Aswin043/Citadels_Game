# 🏰 Citadels – Java-Based Card Game 🎴

A console-based Java implementation of the popular strategy card game **Citadels**, where players take on character roles, build districts, and compete for wealth and victory points.

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

In **Citadels**, each player selects a character with unique powers (e.g., Assassin, Thief, King), gains gold or draws cards, and builds district cards to develop their city. The game ends when a player builds 8 districts, and the winner is determined based on the richness and diversity of their city.

This project replicates the core mechanics of the game in a modular Java application.
